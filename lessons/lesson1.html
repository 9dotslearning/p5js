        <p>STUDENTS NEED TO CREATE ACCOUNTS AND MEET THE P5.JS ONLINE EDITOR, STEP BY STEP.
          THEY ALSO NEED A FRAMEWORK TO PUT P5.JS INTO PERSPECTIVE.</P>
        <p>A <em>computer programming language</em> is a set of words and symbols that you can use to control what your computer does.
          There are hundreds languages, and each one has unique strengths. <strong>p5.js</strong> is especially good at making web-based creative projects,
          but it has many other capabilities as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>p5.js</strong> is closely related to several other languages. It's a specialized version (called a <em>library</em>) of JavaScript, which
          makes web pages respond to clicks, mouse movements, time, date, location, and many other events. In addition, <strong>p5.js</strong> is closely related to a language called Processing,
          which, like <strong>p5.js,</strong> makes creative projects. But Processing projects are more difficult to create and change on the web,
          so we'll focus on <strong>p5.js</strong> instead.
